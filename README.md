Photoshop Spaces Adapter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adobe-photoshop/spaces-adapter.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/adobe-photoshop/spaces-adapter)
=================

This repository contains:

1. A collection of JavaScript modules, which wrap the low-level Spaces plug-in API into a more friendly, mid-level API.
2. A library of action descriptors, which can be submitted to the Spaces plug-in to drive Photoshop and inspect its state.

These modules are a dependency of the Photoshop Design Space application. For more information, see the [spaces-design repository](https://github.com/adobe-photoshop/spaces-design/).
